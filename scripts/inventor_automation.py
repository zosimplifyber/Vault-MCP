"""
Inventor COM automation helpers. Two callers, two jobs.

**The release workflow** (``scripts/release_workflow.py``) drives a running
(or freshly launched) Inventor instance to:
  * open an assembly from a local working-folder path
  * trigger the Vault add-in to "Get Latest" on the file (so all referenced
    parts are pulled local before the rebuild)
  * rebuild / Update2 the assembly
  * save the assembly (which lets the Vault add-in mark it dirty for check-in)

**The formed fiber handoff tool** (``gui/formed_fiber_handoff.py``) reads a
part's computed mass and volume — ``read_part_physical_properties`` — to fill
the Bone Dry Weight and Part Volume fields on its document.

Why COM and not REST?
---------------------
For the release workflow: the Vault REST v2 API can download file *bytes*
directly, but it cannot restore a working-folder layout (relative paths,
library paths, custom content centre links) the way the Vault add-in does.
The Inventor add-in also handles linked-file resolution. So for any release
that needs the assembly to actually open and rebuild correctly, we drive
Inventor.

For the handoff tool: Vault simply has no such properties. None of its 125
property definitions is Mass, Volume, Density or Thickness, so there is
nothing for a REST call to return. Adding a Vault UDP mapped to Inventor's
Mass was the alternative, and was rejected — it needs a Vault Settings change
plus a re-index before existing files carry it.

A caller on a worker thread
---------------------------
The release workflow calls from the CLI's main thread; the handoff GUI calls
from a worker thread, where COM must be initialised explicitly.
``read_part_physical_properties`` therefore handles its own
``CoInitialize``/``CoUninitialize``. The older entry points do not, and are
main-thread only.

Requires `pywin32` (`pip install pywin32`) and a local Inventor install.
The module is import-safe on machines without Inventor — every entry point
raises a clear `InventorUnavailableError` if the COM object cannot be
created, so the workflow can degrade to "open this assembly manually".

    exact ``* 1000`` and volume needs no conversion at all. The iProperty

    fibre density. Inventor substitutes a default material rather than
